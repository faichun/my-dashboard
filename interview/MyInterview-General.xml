    <answer>
Hello, I am ____.

I've been working in IT development for over 20 years, mainly with banking and finance sector. 

Currrently, I work at Tata Consultancy Services as a Solution Architect role. They have assigned me to two projects.

The 1st project is the Loan Origination migration in Westpac. 
I helped the team to study a new vendor product, complete the proof of concept and create the framework for their integration development.
The project gave me a chance to learn a new architecture requirement and design the ways on using the vendor product in the Loan Origination.
The primary language used in the project was Java, and the vendor product is Lightbend Kalix.

After one year in Westpac project, the contract finished. 
TCS assigned me to a RamsayHealth project for their intergration and API management development on Cloud platforms.
During this time, I've learnt to develop application on Cloud.
The primary language used in the project was JavaScript, and the cloud platforms are GCP and AWS.
I learnt to use Anthos, APIGEE, Kubernetes to build up a multicloud platforms for RamsayHealth.

Before TCS employment, I was in HSBC as a technical lead in API and Integration domain for over 10 years. 
The last rile was to lead the team in China and India for the Core Engineering Platform for mircoservices development.
I was so grateful to work in such a global company so that 
I could meet different people in different business domain around the world 
as well as involve in many challenging entreprise projects, covering from backend, to middleware, frontend, and DevOps implementation.

I'm excited to take this interview opportunity, 
because I'm looking forward to using what I know about technology and problem-solving to help Google create new and better services for people around the world.
